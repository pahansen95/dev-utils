# Development Agent

## Vision
Development Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance developer productivity by automating information management and knowledge acquisition. Our goal is to reduce cognitive toil, streamline the research process, and improve the quality of software solutions.

## Key Features (Planned)

1. **Adaptive Knowledge Summarization**: Automatically generate concise, context-aware summaries of project documentation and code.
2. **Context-Aware Query Expansion**: Enhance developer queries with relevant project context for more accurate and helpful responses.
3. **Knowledge Application Prompter**: Suggest relevant, previously acquired knowledge that can be applied to current tasks or problems.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.12+
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies
- Git for version control

## Project Goals

- Assist developers in articulating cognitive systems and designing mental models
- Enhance efficiency in acquiring, retaining, and applying knowledge in the engineering process
- Complement existing development tools to create a more productive programming environment

## Installation
